In Flutter, widgets are the essential building blocks for creating user interfaces. Common widgets like Text, Image, and various Button types (such as ElevatedButton and TextButton) enable developers to easily display text, images, and interactive buttons. Layout widgets like Row and Column organize elements horizontally or vertically, while the Container widget provides flexibility with padding, margins, and backgrounds. For user input, the TextField widget allows data entry, and ListView offers a scrollable list of items. These common widgets simplify UI design, making it easier to build responsive and interactive apps.
